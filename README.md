# Mission

Aurae is on a mission to be the most loved and effective way of managing
workloads on a node. Our hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a
node, we can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.

# Introduction

[Aurae] is a memory-safe[^memory-safe] runtime daemon, process manager, and
PID-1 initialization system designed to remotely schedule processes, containers,
and virtual machines as well as set node configurations like networking storage.

Through system proportioning and enterprise workload isolation techniques, the
Aurae [open-source] project can complement Kubernetes, as Aurae supports the
usage of multi-tenant workloads and enterprise identities all the way down to
the socket layer.

## Project Status

> **STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**<br>
> **The Aurae project and API can change without notice.**<br> 
> **Do not run the project in production until further notice!**
> <br>

- The Aurae project welcomes contributions of all kinds and sizes.
- Please read the "[getting involved]" documentation before contributing to the
  project.
- You do not have to know [Rust] to join the project.

By joining the project in its early phases, you'll participate in the
development of a milestone candidate for enterprise distributed systems and
automation.

## **In more detail**

Aurae enables the control of each internal runtime process on a piece of
hardware or node as its [PID]-1 instance on a [Linux kernel] and offers
mTLS-encrypted gRPC APIs for managing processes through
[workload isolation with Aurae cells] [^cells].

Furthermore, Aurae also enables the management of [virtual machines] and
containers by adding additional features comparable to those of [Firecracker]
and [containerd] and combining effective node management with additional
controls while offering a scope comparable to that of [systemd]. In doing so,
Aurae takes ownership of all runtime processes on a single piece of hardware and
provides [mTLS]-encrypted [gRPC] APIs (the [Aurae standard library]) to manage
these processes in [Aurae cells].

The inherent compatibility with Kubernetes and the capacity to function as a
systemd [substitute](#project-status) enable commendable performance in
enterprise settings to meet the demands of distributed systems both now and in
the future [^medium].

---

Many parts of the Aurae runtime system and the Aurae standard library use the
core definitions in predefined [.proto] files from this repository for their
automatic generation. While TypeScript files can be leveraged to replace static
manifests, such as YAML, as well as interact directly with a running system.

|||
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auraed**      | To ensure memory safety, Aurae serves the generic system's runtime daemon ([auraed]).|
| **AuraeScript** | The [AuraeScript] (a Turing-complete scripting language built on TypeScript) library automatically generates itself from the pre-defined [.proto] files defined in the Aurae standard library.<br>It also directly embeds [Deno] source code to provide an SDK and the functionality to attach remote clients for the direct remote communication with Aurae. |
|||

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env auraescript
let cells = new runtime.CellServiceClient();

let allocated = await cells.allocate(<runtime.AllocateCellRequest>{
  cell: runtime.Cell.fromPartial({
    name: "my-cell",
    cpus: "2",
  }),
});

let started = await cells.start(<runtime.StartExecutableRequest>{
  executable: runtime.Executable.fromPartial({
    cellName: "my-cell",
    command: "sleep 4000",
    description: "Sleep for 4000 seconds",
    name: "sleep-4000",
  }),
});
```

| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication**               | Aurae extends [SPIFFE]/[SPIRE] (x509 mTLS)-backed identity, authentication (authn), and authorization (authz) in a distributed system down to the Unix domain socket layer. |
| **Principle of Least Awareness** | A single Aurae instance has no awareness of higher order scheduling mechanisms such as the Kubernetes control plane.                                                        |
| **Runtime Workloads**            | The Aurae runtime API can manage [virtual machines], [executables], [cells], [pods], and other [spawned Aurae instances].                                                   |
| **The Aurae Standard Library**   | The Aurae project exposes its functionality as a gRPC API through the [Aurae standard library]. The [V0 API reference] contains the current library definition.             |

<!-- +Footnotes -->

[^cells]:
    Additionally, with Aurae cells, the project provides various ways to partition
    and slice up systems allowing for isolation strategies in enterprise workloads.

[^compare]:
    As a low-level building block, the Aurae Project works well with any
    higher-order system by offering a thoughtful set of API calls and controls for
    managing workloads on a node or single piece of hardware.

[^memory-safe]: 
    The reliability and effectiveness of the Rust systems language make it an excellent choice for the development of the Aurae project. [Learn more about Rust]
