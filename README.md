# Mission

Aurae is on a mission to be the most loved and effective way of managing
workloads on a node. Our hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a
node, we can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.

# Introduction

[Aurae] is a memory-safe [^memory-safe] runtime daemon, process manager, and
PID-1 initialization system designed to remotely schedule processes, containers,
and virtual machines as well as set node configurations like networking storage.

Through system proportioning and enterprise workload isolation techniques, the
Aurae [open-source] project can complement Kubernetes, as Aurae supports the
usage of multi-tenant workloads and enterprise identities all the way down to
the socket layer.

# Project Status

> **STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**<br> 
> **The Aurae project and API can change without notice.**<br> 
> **Do not run the project in production until further notice!**

- The Aurae project welcomes contributions of all kinds and sizes.
- Please read the "[getting involved]" documentation before contributing to the
  project.
- You do not have to know [Rust] to join the project.

By joining the project in its early phases, you'll participate in the
development of a milestone candidate for enterprise distributed systems and
automation.

# **Expanded Overview**

By [introducing Aurae cells] on top of a [Linux kernel] the control of each
internal runtime process on a given node becomes possible because auraed takes
ownership of every process by becoming the [PID]-1 instance. This enabled the
creation of extended system and service management capabilities [^compare].
Allowing for advanced use with Kubernetes and the
[realization](#project-status) of a [systemd]-like scope within the distributed
systems themselves.

[Aurae cells] [^cells] improve maintenance and accessibility on a given node
within [virtual machines] and containers, as they will serve as a systemd
substitute that can run below Kubernetes [^medium]. While also adapting
desirable feature sets such as those from [Firecracker] and [Containerd] and
including [mTLS]-encrypted [gRPC] APIs (the Aurae standard library) that become
exposed to allow management and configuration of internal processes.

Many parts of the Aurae runtime system and the Aurae standard library use core
definitions from predefined [.proto] files within this repository for their
build processes. While TypeScript files allow for the replacement of static
manifests, such as [YAML], and make direct interactions with a running system
possible.

| **Auraed**      | To ensure memory safety, Aurae serves the generic system's runtime daemon ([auraed]).|
| **AuraeScript** | The [AuraeScript] (a Turing-complete scripting language built on TypeScript) library automatically generates itself from the pre-defined [.proto] files defined in the Aurae standard library.<br>It also directly embeds [Deno] source code to provide an SDK and the functionality to attach remote clients for the direct remote communication with Aurae. |
|||

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env auraescript
let cells = new runtime.CellServiceClient();

let allocated = await cells.allocate(<runtime.AllocateCellRequest>{
  cell: runtime.Cell.fromPartial({
    name: "my-cell",
    cpus: "2",
  }),
});

let started = await cells.start(<runtime.StartExecutableRequest>{
  executable: runtime.Executable.fromPartial({
    cellName: "my-cell",
    command: "sleep 4000",
    description: "Sleep for 4000 seconds",
    name: "sleep-4000",
  }),
});
```

| **Authentication**               | Aurae extends [SPIFFE]/[SPIRE] (x509 mTLS)-backed identity, authentication (authn), and authorization (authz) in a distributed system down to the Unix domain socket layer. |
| **Principle of Least Awareness** | A single Aurae instance has no awareness of higher order scheduling mechanisms such as the Kubernetes control plane.                                                        |
| **Runtime Workloads**            | The Aurae runtime API can manage [virtual machines], [executables], [cells], [pods], and other [spawned Aurae instances].                                                   |
| **The Aurae Standard Library**   | The Aurae project exposes its functionality as a gRPC API through the [Aurae standard library]. The [V0 API reference] contains the current library definition.             |

<!-- +Footnotes -->

[^cells]:
    Additionally, with Aurae cells, the project provides various ways to partition
    and slice up systems allowing for isolation strategies in enterprise workloads.

[^compare]:
    As a low-level building block, the Aurae Project works well with any
    higher-order system by offering a thoughtful set of API calls and controls for
    managing workloads on a single node.

[^memory-safe]: 
    The reliability and effectiveness of the Rust systems language make it an excellent choice for the development of the Aurae project. [Learn more about Rust]
